    "## Counting characters\n",

    "## EXTRA: Sorting the character counts\n",
    "The plots in the previous exercise look a bit messy since the character count data is not ordered in any reasonable way. Due to the iteration over the passwords and the characters, the characters are currently just ordered by their first occurrence in the password dataset. For all three categories it would be nice to sort the values in descending order such that the characters are ordered by their frequencies from left to right in the plot. Alternatively, you could also sort the alphabetic data by the keys in alphabetic order (meaning \"A\" to \"Z\"), and you could sort the numeric data by the keys in numeric order (meaning \"0\" to \"9\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options to approach the sorting. You can either use the native Python function `sorted()` or you can make use of the NumPy package and the functions `np.sort()` and `np.argsort()`. If you want to try the former option, read the section on using the `key` parameter in the `sorted()` function [here](https://realpython.com/sort-python-dictionary/#using-the-key-parameter-and-lambda-functions). If you want to use the NumPy approach, just read the remaining instructions in this cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though NumPy is optimized for numerical data, the sorting functions also work for string data. If you sort an array of strings, it is ordered alphabetically from \"A\" to \"Z\" based on the first character in each string. Even though this might sound a bit complicated, this approach is used whenever strings have to be sorted, for example books in a library. The catch here is that you have to sort the keys together with the values, but to use the NumPy functions you need to separate the keys and values into two arrays. Note that you cannot directly create arrays from the dictionary keys and dictionary values, you have to pass them to the built-in function `list()` before turning them into an array:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "keys = np.array(list(alphabetic_counts.keys()))\n",
    "values = np.array(list(alphabetic_counts.values()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function `np.sort()` can sort the arrays individually but if you want to keep the arrays aligned during the sorting, you have to use the function `np.argsort()`. Instead of the sorted array, this function will return indices that you can use to sort both arrays (the keys and the values).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with the alphabetic character counts, sort them by their keys and show the sorted data in a bar plot. Use either of the two options mentioned above.\n",
    "- Sort the numeric character counts by the keys and by the values. Display your results in two different plots.\n",
    "- Sort the three dictionaries individually by their values and merge the data again. You can then display the three categories in a single plot."
