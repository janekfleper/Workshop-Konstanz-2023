This is already quite convenient, but there is an even quicker way using the package pandas. Besides the `pd.DataFrame()`, there is also the `pd.Series()` which works like a single column of a data frame. A series consists of one data column and a corresponding index. You can think of it as a hybrid of an array and a dictionary, but compared to a dictionary the series is suited for numerical data.\n",
