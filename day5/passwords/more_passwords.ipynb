    "A palindrome is a word/string that reads the same backwards as forwards, for example \"radar\" or \"level\". Instead of just checking all passwords whether they are a palindrome or not, the exercise is to count the number of matching characters up to the middle when reading the password backwards and forwards. If the number of characters is odd, you can include the middle character in the count. See the following examples to clarify how the palindrome depth is defined:\n",
