    "## Identifying special characters\n",
    "The previous categorization only distinguishes between alphabetic characters and numeric characters using the respective string methods `isalpha()` and `isnumeric()`. Unfortunately, checking a string for special characters such as `\"!\"`, `\"?\"` etc... is not implemented as a string method ([source](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)). The solution to this problem is to assume that any character that is neither alphabetic nor numeric must be a special character. In Python you can implement this using an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement. The following code snippet shows how you could check if the password is between 8 and 16 characters long\n",

In general, you can use any number of `elif` statements, even no `elif` statement at all. If you only want to check one condition, you can omit the `elif` statement and just use `if` and `else`. As you (implicitely) learned in an earlier exercise, the `else` statement is also optional. If you don't need to handle the case where the initial condition is `False`, it is perfectly fine to just use the `if` statement.\n",
