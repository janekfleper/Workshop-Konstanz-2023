    "If a password is not considered to be secure enough, it would be convenient to have an algorithm that automatically modifies the password to meet the security requirements. Just appending `\"aA1\"` to every password to meet the latter two requirements would be too easy to crack. The modification(s) should therefore depend on the original password. You can do this with the string methods that are built into Python. For a list of available methods see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp or just find a list online.  \n",
    "Since strings cannot be modified in place in Python (they are immutable) the best approach is to work with a list of the individual characters. You can then replace/modify the characters by assigning a new/modified character to the corresponding index in the list. After the modification(s) you can turn the list of characters into a string again with the method `\"\".join()`. See the following code snippet as an illustration. In the password `\"hello\"` the character `\"e\"` is manually replaced by the character `\"3\"` to fulfill the numeric requirement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "password = \"hello\"\n",
    "characters = [char for char in password]\n",
    "characters[1] = \"3\"\n",
    "modified_password = \"\".join(characters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: Passwords with these simple modifications are still considered to be weak according to [wikipedia/password_strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Examples_of_weak_passwords) and [wikipedia/password_cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking#Easy_to_remember,_hard_to_guess) since these checks can be easily automated. Nevertheless, it's a good exercise on working with strings.\n",

    "- Write the code to make any password pass the requirements above. You can follow the next bullet points or you can get creative and try to find your own solution.\n",
    "- If there is no lower/upper-case character, replace the first suitable character with its upper/lower-case counterpart.\n",
    "- If there is no numeric character, replace the first suitable character (lower-case or upper-case) by its [leet-speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#Table_of_leet-speak_substitutes_for_normal_letters) counterpart. The most common options are `E->3, S->5, B->8, I->1, A->4`.\n",
    "- If the password is not long enough, repeat it until the minimum required length is reached/exceeded.\n",
    "- If you cannot automatically modify the password to meet the requirements, print a message that states why the modification failed.\n",
    "- If you were able to automatically modify the password, print a message that contains the new password.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your password modification you can try the cases from the table below. Copy the initial password from the table and check if your modified password looks the same. Some of the impossible modifications assume that only the \"most common\" numeric replacements from the exercise are used. If you included more replacments, the modification might be possible anyway.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**It's perfectly fine if your password modification algorithm does not work for all of the last five examples from the table, these are some special edge cases to push the boundaries of the modification algorithm. If you want to improve your algorithm, make sure that you understand where/why the edge cases failed beforehand.**\n",
