    "## Loading passwords with a function\n",
    "In the last notebook you learned how to open a text file containing passwords and to read it line by line. You stripped the newline character from each line and you stored the lines in the list of passwords, unless the line was empty. Since you are going to reuse this code many times, it is a perfect candidate to be implemented in a function. The function needs to have one (string) parameter which is the name of the file, and the function should return the preprocessed and filtered list of passwords. You can use the following template for the function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def load_passwords(path):\n",
    "    # load the passwords here\n",
    "    return passwords\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the function that returns a list of passwords from a text file. You can use the template above or write the function from scratch.\n",
    "- What happens if you call the function without any argument `load_passwords()`? The error message will tell you exactly what is wrong with the function call.\n",
    "- Load the passwords from the file `passwords.txt` into a list. How many passwords in the list only contain numeric characters?\n",
    "- EXTRA: Add a boolean parameter called `load_empty` that allows you to optionally load empty passwords. If you call the function with the argument `load_empty=True`, the empty lines should be included in the list of passwords."

    "Instead of the function `np.bincount()`, you can also use the function `np.unique()` to get the length distribution.

If you have an array called `lengths`, the function `np.unique(lengths)` will return the unique values in the array `lengths` in ascending order. \n",

    "With an increasing number of passwords, there will also be an increasing number of duplicate passwords. (Actually, there were already a few duplicates in the first 100 passwords.

    "## Sorting the passwords\n",
    "The current order of the unique passwords is somewhat unfortunate to further analyze the data, since there are just some weird passwords beginning with special characters at the start of the array of **unique** passwords. Sorting the arrays by the counts in descending order would make a lot more sense, the most recurring passwords would then come first in the arrays. If you just want to sort the array of counts, you can directly do that with the function `np.sort()`. By default the counts will be sorted in ascending order but you can reverse the array with the indexing `[::-1]`. See the following code snippet to sort an array in descending order:\n",

    "```\n",
    "The problem here is that you will only sort the counts but not the unique passwords and their lengths. Instead of directly sorting the counts, you should therefore use the function `np.argsort()` that will return the indices to sort the counts. See the following code snippet that will have the same result as the example above:\n",

    "## Keeping arrays in a data frame\n",
    "The sorting process of the three arrays in the previous section showed you that it is not very convenient to manage multiple NumPy arrays manually. In principle, you could stack the three arrays from the previous exercise to create a two-dimensional NumPy array. The data would then remain aligned if you change the order in any way. However, since one of the arrays stores string data and the other two arrays store integer data, this data is not suitable to be combined in a single array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The package [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (imported as `pd` by convention) resolves this issue with a so-called data frame that works very similar to a spreadsheet (from Excel or LibreOffice Calc). A data frame has an index (as an identifier of the rows) and columns to store the data. Each column in the data frame works just like a NumPy array, but the columns are not required to all have the same type. A data frame is therefore suited to store mixed data, such as your passwords, the counts and the lengths. See the following code snippet to create a data frame from the (unsorted) arrays:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(dict(password=unique_passwords, count=password_counts, length=lengths))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The variable name `df` is often used for data frames but you can use any other variable name here. The keys in the dictionary will be the names of the columns and the values are the column data. By default, the index goes from `0` to the `len(unique_passwords) - 1`, just like `range(len(unique_passwords))` or `np.arange(len(unique_passwords))`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly create a plot from the data frame using the method `df.plot(x, y)`. The method only needs the names of the columns and the data is then taken from the data frame. See the following code snippet to plot the counts as a function of the length:\n",

    "df.plot(\"length\", \"count\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- How can you change the column names when creating the data frame? You do not have to find better names for the columns, just try any other names to understand how the renaming works.\n",
    "- Use the data frame method `df.plot()` to display the counts as a function of the length. Look at the docstring of the method to find out which parameter you have to change to get a scatter plot. How can you change the marker and the color?"
